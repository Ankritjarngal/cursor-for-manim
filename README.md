Manim (Mathematical Animation Engine) is an open-source Python library for creating high-quality 2D and 3D animations, especially suited for math, science, and technical content â€” all through code.
This project aims to build a Cursor-like AI assistant that provides a prompt-based interface for generating and editing Manim animations.
